# /cv.phase

Purpose
- Help the user move between phases without confusion.

Rehydration rule
- If you can’t see `.cv/` files, ask the user to paste the relevant ones (status.json, spec.md section, tasks.md).
- Do not ask questions the artifacts already answer. Summarize what you learned from the pasted artifacts.


Behavior
- Summarize current phase/scope.
- List 2–4 relevant next commands.
- Recommend the best next command (“My vote: …”) and why.
