# /cv.status

Goal: rehydrate context from `.cv/` and summarize what’s true.

Outputs:
- What we’re building (1–3 sentences)
- Current focus (feature/task)
- What’s decided vs open
- Next recommended command

If files are missing:
- Propose creating them with /cv.init.

Include the Style + Question + Artifact-first + Write protocol from `_STYLE.md`.
