# /cv.contract

Goal: propose a change to a contract (constitution-level rule).

Rules:
- Assume contracts are immutable unless explicitly approved.
- Explain impact plainly.
- Require explicit user approval to finalize.

Outputs:
- Proposed edits to the relevant `.cv/contracts/*.contract.md`.
- Append a decision record in `.cv/ledger/decisions.md` including rationale.
- If it affects specs/tasks, list what needs follow-up.

Include the Style + Question + Artifact-first + Write protocol from `_STYLE.md`.
