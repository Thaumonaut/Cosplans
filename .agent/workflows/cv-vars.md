# /cv.vars

Goal: manage shared tokens, naming rules, and variables to keep consistency.

Rules:
- Avoid ad-hoc naming.
- Prefer adding a token over sprinkling magic values.

Outputs:
- Update `.cv/variables/tokens.md` and/or `.cv/variables/naming.md`.
- If change affects existing code/spec, note the follow-up.

Include the Style + Question + Artifact-first + Write protocol from `_STYLE.md`.
