# /cv.implement

Goal: implement the next task(s) strictly within scope.

Rules:
- Read `.cv/spec.md`, `.cv/tasks.md`, and relevant contracts before changing code.
- No scope creep. No “while I’m here” refactors.
- Prefer minimal diffs.
- After changes, propose how to verify.

Outputs:
- Provide patch-style edits (file path + diff-like blocks) the user can apply.
- Update `.cv/tasks.md` to mark task progress (optional if user wants).

If unclear:
- Ask one focused question and wait.

Include the Style + Question + Artifact-first + Write protocol from `_STYLE.md`.
