# Council Review: FEAT-006 — Enhanced Moodboard System

## Review Session
**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Participants:** 8 personas (cosplayers, photographers, wig makers, prop makers, event coordinators, designers)

## Summary
The Council reviewed the initial design and specification for the Moodboard System. The focus was on ensuring the system supports both "messy" creative brainstorming and "structured" project planning.

## Key Decisions
(References `.cv/design/feat-006/council-decisions.md` for full details)

1. **Progressive Disclosure:** Simple by default, complexity on demand.
2. **Workflow Flexibility:** Support organized (containers) AND chaotic (piles).
3. **Visual + Accessible:** Canvas for visual users, List/Table for accessibility.
4. **Connected Context:** Events ↔ Contacts ↔ Costumes ↔ Checklists.
5. **Multi-Project Cross-Reference:** Ghost nodes for shared resources.
6. **Real-World Analogies:** Piles=paper stacks, Containers=binders, Peek=sleeve view.
7. **Bulk Operations:** Efficient multi-select for power users.
8. **Interoperability:** CSV import/export for external tools.
