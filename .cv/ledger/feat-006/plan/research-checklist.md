## 💡 Research Tips

1. **Don't just screenshot - interact**: Click, drag, test features
2. **Note your emotional response**: What feels delightful? Frustrating?
3. **Test edge cases**: What happens with 100+ items? Empty states?
4. **Compare mobile vs desktop**: How do interactions differ?
5. **Time your tasks**: How long to add 10 items? Important for UX!
6. **Think about your users**: Would a cosplayer understand this?
7. **Look for consistency**: Do similar features work the same way?
8. **Check for accessibility**: Can you use it with keyboard only?

---

## 📞 Questions to Answer

As you research, keep these in mind:

1. **Canvas**: How smooth is 60fps zoom/pan? What makes it feel good?
2. **Nodes**: What size feels right? How much whitespace?
3. **Connections**: Straight lines or curves? How are they created?
4. **Tags**: Inline editing or modal? How many visible at once?
5. **Views**: How fast does switching feel? Any loading states?
6. **Tables**: Click or double-click to edit? Tab to next cell?
7. **Timeline**: Vertical or horizontal default? Both?
8. **Mobile**: Touch targets big enough? Gestures intuitive?
9. **Sharing**: How prominent is "Share" button? Modal or dropdown?
10. **Comments**: OAuth only or allow anonymous? Thread style?
