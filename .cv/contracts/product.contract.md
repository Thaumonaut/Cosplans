## Project-Centric Planning (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Projects are the central organizing principle for **planning-related features**.

### Project-Scoped Features

- Project creation and management
- Tasks and timelines
- Budget tracking
- Event planning (conventions, photoshoots, meetups)
- Resource management (props, materials, outfits)
- Characters, moodboards, references tied to projects

### User/Team-Scoped Features (exempt from project requirement)

- Authentication and user settings
- Team management and membership
- Marketplace profiles and services
- General messaging (team chat)
- Personal resource libraries (can be linked to projects when used)

## Complete Workflow Coverage

The application MUST support the entire cosplay lifecycle without gaps:

| Phase | MVP Features |
|-------|--------------|
| Ideation & Planning | References, moodboards, initial concepts |
| Active Creation | Task management, budget tracking, resource organization |
| Event Execution | Convention planning, photoshoot coordination, crew management |
| Post-Production | Photo editing tracking, social media planning and scheduling |
| Archival | Completed project reference and portfolio showcasing |

## MVP First Principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Features MUST be developed as simple, functional MVPs before adding complexity:

- Deliver immediate user value in simplest form
- Be independently testable and deployable
- Avoid premature optimization or feature creep
- Support future enhancement without requiring rewrites

## AI Philosophy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Allowed (Assistive AI)

- **Task breakdown** — Suggest subtasks for a goal
- **Planning assistance** — Pace suggestions, deadline calculations
- **Budget estimation** — Rough cost estimates for materials
- **Photoshoot locations** — Suggest locations based on character/theme
- **Set design ideas** — Suggest props, backdrops, compositions
- **Pose suggestions** — Reference poses for characters

### Forbidden (Creative AI)

- **NO image editing** — No "enhance," "fix," "improve" features
- **NO video editing** — No AI-generated video modifications
- **NO art generation** — No generating cosplay designs or artwork
- **NO "make it look better"** — The human's creativity is sacred

### Principle

AI helps with logistics and planning. AI does NOT replace human creativity. Users come to cosplay to express themselves, not to have a machine do it for them.

## Monetization Strategy

AI capabilities are the PRIMARY premium offering:

| Tier | Features |
|------|----------|
| Free | Core cosplay management, 10 AI requests/month |
| Premium | Unlimited core features, 500 AI requests/month, advanced analytics |

AI features are **opt-in** — users explicitly enable them, never forced.
